# Toilet Leech is Real (Beta)

This mod implements a fully custom enemy, the Toilet Leech, into the game.

### Behavior

For now, the Toilet Leech is an outside enemy. This might or might not be changed in the future.
It also currently spawns very often for testing purposes. This will be changed once the mod is out of beta.

The Toilet Leech will wander around the map and if a player gets close enough, it will get in front of the player and it will occasionally decide to come a bit closer and try to swing its head and damage you.

Also, the enemy has 4 health.

### Bugs

When the enemy dies, the dying animation might not get completely applied, especially the head might stay bopping.

If you find any bugs, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Hamunii/ToiletLeechIsReal/issues)!
