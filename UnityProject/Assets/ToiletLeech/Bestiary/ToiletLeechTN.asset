    Sigurd''s danger level: 30%


    Scientific name:
    Hirudinea Toiletus


    Toilet Leech is a large species of leech that seem have
    evolved to gain a toilet as its torso. We are unsure how this could have happened,
    especially since toilets are invented by humans and are very different from crabs.
    It''s also a complete mystery how they learned to sing.


    Toilet Leeches
    appear to be lacking in intelligence, and they just wander around in the lands
    outside, bopping their heads along their beat. However, they are aware of their
    surroundings and will attack when you are too close. They seem to like attacking
    from in front of you rather than from back, though they will still ram through
    you if you have your back against them.


    The Toilet Leech! The Toilet Leech
    is real! - Sigurd'
