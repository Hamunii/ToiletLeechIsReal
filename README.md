# Toilet Leech Is Real

This revolutionary Lethal Company mod brings to life the unused toilet leech enemy which exists deep within the game files.

Mod developers: After reading this README (so you know the state of this resource -->), go to [Assets/AboutAssets.md](Assets/AboutAssets.md) for information on how to work with assets and build asset bundles in order to create your own enemy mod, using this repo as a starting point!

### Looking for a mod install link?
This is the GitHub repository where the source code of this mod is hosted. **Mod files are not found here**, but will be uploaded to Thunderstore once this mod is ready enough.

### AboutAssets.md resource progress

NOTE: Contributions are welcome! This will help new modders get started with making custom enemies, so it would be super awesome if you contributed your knowledge and shared some useful resources! Feel free to open an issue or ping me on discord under the toilet leech post or DM me! This resource could possibly find its way to the Lethal Company Modding Wiki.
