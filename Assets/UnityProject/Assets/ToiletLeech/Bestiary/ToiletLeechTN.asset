    Sigurd''s danger level: 60%


    Scientific name:
    Hirudinea Toiletus

    Toilet Leech is a large species of leech that have evolved
    to survive in areas inhabited by intelligent lifeforms. They prey on unsuspecting
    victims by first claiming a toilet as their new shell and when the victim needs
    to go to the toilet, it strikes and starts sucking the victim off until they
    have no blood left. After this, they devour their victim from inside out, only
    leaving a flesh suit behind. However, it has been theorized that their vicims
    minds at least partly become one with the Toilet leech''s, as they have been
    seen attempting to speak out loud their victims'' loved ones names, despite the
    creature seemingly not being particularly intelligent by itself.'
